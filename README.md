## 📗 About

This project consists of an application that, in addition to having the pomodoro timer to help you with your studies, will also have other types of timers, so you can time what you want, when you want from wherever you want and never forget your recipe on the stove again.<br>
I made this app with the aim of studying state management with MobX and Dependency Injection with Provider;<br>
To do this, I developed the application by watching a Udemy course from Cod3r.
